# Inhabitent Project  ![My Awsome badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/%F0%9F%90%99-Awsome-red.svg)
Inhabitent website is a <em><b>RESPONSIVE, CUSTOM THEME</b></em>, multiple pages dynamic website powered by WordPress 

# Motivation
It is my first WordPress project, complete in a reletively short period. A lot of things that I have learned not only the technics but also the ways of thinking and problem solving.

# Learnings about WordPress
Things about WordPress I have learned during the prject, including but not limit to:
## 1. Basic WordPress

## 2. Custom Theme

## 3. WordPress Functions

## 4. Custom Post Types, Taxonomies & Fields

## 5. Custom Post Loops & the WP Database

## 6. OOP, Plugin Dev & Widget API


# Learnings about PHP
## 1. Running PHP locally with MAMP
As a backend lanuage, PHP only runs in the server side and makes dynamic websites. Compare to Javascrip, PHP that has been using to create websites has longer history and I feel the ways it works and its syntax is more closed to the lower level programming language.
## 2. The Language
Same as learning all the languages: expressions, variables, comments, operators, condition statement, for and while loops(which have been used a lot in this project), arrays and functions(which have been used a lot in this project as well),Including and requiring files, alternative syntax and ternary Operators.

# JavaScrip (Jquery)
Not much Jquerys used in this project. First is the search Icon on the nav bar toggle focus on click and blur when click away. Second place used Jquery is the nav bar that alter the style to be absolutely positioned with a reverse colour scheme on pages with hero images at the top, and transition to the standard site header once the user has scrolled past the hero image to the rest of the page content.

# Technologies used
## MAMP:
a local server environment that allows WordPress to run in personal computer
## Git & GitHub: 
which is not new to me but a awsome version control tool that saves a lot of troubles and time.
## WordPress: 
and of course the opern sourced content management system, contain both backend and frontend interface
## Sequel Pro:
a database management application for working with MySQL databases,license learned that always backup the database incase of something unpredictable curcumstance like accidentally delete the whole database.

# Some cool stretch code and creemshot
